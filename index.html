            <h2>Mahendra Singh Dhoni: A timeline</h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>December 23, 2004</u>:</strong> Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is
                    run out for 0 after facing one ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>April 5, 2005</u>:</strong>The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores
                    of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and
                    proceeds to smash 148 off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's
                    356/9. The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>October 31, 2005</u>: </strong>Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record
                    183* against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to
                    spare. Batting at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up
                    3-0 in the best-of-seven series.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>September 13, 2007</u></strong>: Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is
                    a wash out against Scotland in their ICC World Twenty20 opener. Few could have predicted how India's
                    tournament will pan out.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>September 24, 2007</u></strong>: India win the inaugural World Twenty20 by beating
                    Pakistan in an absolute humdinger in Johannesburg. Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the
                    landscape of T20 cricket is changed forever.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>October 2, 2007</u>: I</strong>n the next match in Kochi, Dhoni scores his first fifty as
                    captain - 58 off 88 balls - as India are beaten by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match
                    series.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>November 15, 2007</u>:</strong> First ODI series win for Dhoni as captain, as India beat
                    Pakistan by six wickets in Gwalior to take the lead 3-1 in the best-of-five series. His
                    contribution? An unbeaten 45 off 45 balls as 256 is chased with six wickets in hand.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>March 4, 2008</u>: </strong>A momentous occasion for India as they win their first ODI
                    series in Australia. The landmark comes in the second final of the CB Series, which India win by
                    nine runs to make it 2-0.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>November 26, 2008</u>:</strong> Dhoni's first 5-0 sweep of any team. Victory by six
                    wickets in Cuttack whitewashes Kevin Pietersen's England.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>March 11, 2009</u>:</strong>Dhoni becomes the first Indian captain to win an ODI series
                    in New Zealand. A whirlwind century from Virender Sehwag seals a ten-wicket win in Hamilton.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong><u>February 24, 2010</u>:</strong> India win a three-match series at home over South Africa,
                    riding on Sachin Tendulkar's record-setting 200*. Dhoni injects 68 off 35 balls to a total of 401/3.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong><u>June 24, 2010</u>: </strong>India lift the Asia Cup under Dhoni, beating Sri Lanka by 81
                    runs in Dambulla.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>April 2, 2011</u>:</strong>India win the World Cup after 28 years, with the skipper
                    hitting the winning runs with a six. Promoting himself up the order, Dhoni shrugs off his poor run
                    in the tournament with the innings of his life: 91* off 79 balls.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>October 25, 2011</u>: </strong>India salvage some pride with a 5-0 win over England when
                    Alastair Cook's team visit. Dhoni is Player of the Series.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>June 23, 2013</u>:</strong>Dhoni marshals his troops superbly to lead India to a narrow
                    five-run win in the final of the Champions Trophy over hosts England, thus becoming the first
                    captain to hold all three of the ICC's major titles.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong><u>September 2, 2014</u>:</strong> A sliver of brightness for India away from home. They
                    beat England by nine wickets in Birmingham to win the ODI leg of another difficult tour.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>March 23, 2016</u>: </strong>Dhoni's coolness and ability to back players under immense
                    pressure is to the fore in Bangalore, where Bangladesh are beaten by one run during the World
                    Twenty20. Dhoni helps India pull off an incredible heist.</li><br>
                <li><strong><u>January 4, 2017</u>: </strong>Announces that he is giving up the captaincy, but remains
                    available for selection for the upcoming England series.</li><br>
